# Claude Usage Meter

A Chrome extension that shows your **current Claude session usage** and a live
**countdown to the next limit reset** in a floating button pinned to the
bottom-right corner of [claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

## What it does

- Adds a small floating pill in the bottom-right of every claude.ai page.
- The ring tracks your **5-hour session** usage; the label shows the percent
  and `resets in 2h 14m`. It turns amber at 75% and red at 90%.
- Click the pill for a detail panel with up to four meters:
  - **Session · 5 hr** and **Weekly · 7 day** rate-limit windows, each with its
    own reset.
  - **Context window** — how full the current conversation is (from the exact
    token counts in Claude's streamed responses), e.g. `64.1% · 128k / 200k`.
  - **Extra usage** — your pay-as-you-go spend (`$0.00 / $30.00`), **opt-in**
    via the popup toggle (off by default).
- A toolbar popup mirrors the data, toggles extra usage, and can pin the
  endpoint or clear stored values.

### A note on precision

The rate-limit windows come back as **whole-number percentages** (the server
rounds them — there are no `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers on these calls to
derive anything finer). The **context meter** is computed from exact token
counts, so it shows one decimal (`64.1%`) — and the panel will surface a
decimal for any value that genuinely has one.

**Estimate decimals (experimental, opt-in).** With the toggle on, the session
meter adds an estimated tenths place (`48.3%`). Since usage only climbs within a
fixed window, it learns "tokens per 1%" from the integer jumps it sees, then
divides the tokens consumed since the last jump by that rate. It always snaps to
the authoritative server integer and caps the fraction below the next whole
number, so it only ever affects the tenths place. It's an estimate — it can't
see usage from other tabs/devices/the API, and the per-model token weighting
isn't documented — which is why it's off by default and labelled experimental.
The calibration lives in `src/estimate.js` and is unit-tested.

## How it reads usage

Claude.ai does not expose a documented "usage" API, so the extension observes
(and replays) the network the web app already uses. A page-context script
(`src/inject.js`) wraps `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`, and for `/api/` requests it
scans response **headers** (`anthropic-ratelimit-*`, `retry-after`) and
**JSON/SSE bodies** for anything shaped like a limit, a remaining/used count,
or a reset timestamp (`src/harvest.js`). Findings are forwarded to the content
script, persisted in `chrome.storage.local`, and rendered.

The confirmed source is the same endpoint the Usage page itself loads:

```
GET /api/organizations/{org_uuid}/usage
→ { five_hour: { utilization: 48, resets_at: "…" },   // the "session"
    seven_day: { utilization: 43, resets_at: "…" },   // the weekly window
    limits: [ { kind, percent, resets_at, is_active } … ], spend: {…} }
```

`utilization`/`percent` are **0–100 percentages**, so the meter is percent-based:
the ring and the "Session · 5 hr" row track `five_hour`, and the panel also
shows the `seven_day` weekly window. `src/harvest.js` parses this shape
directly (`parseClaudeUsage`) and falls back to the generic header/SSE scanner
for anything else.

To avoid an empty "no data" state, the extension establishes a **baseline**
three ways, in order of preference:

1. **Discovery (primary).** On load it reads `/api/organizations` (and
   `/api/bootstrap`) to find your org uuid and fetches
   `/api/organizations/{uuid}/usage` directly — so the meter populates on its
   own, no interaction required.
2. **Self-learning.** Any usage URL the app itself calls is remembered and
   re-fetched on later loads and every 5 minutes, keeping the baseline fresh.
3. **Manual pin (optional).** Paste the exact usage request URL into the
   toolbar popup to override discovery.

The **context meter** comes from the streamed completion responses
(`input_tokens` + cached input ÷ the model's context window). The **extra-usage**
line, when enabled, reads `/api/organizations/{uuid}/overage_spend_limit`
(credit amounts are minor units, so `3000` → `$30.00`).

> Note: this is a best-effort reader. If Anthropic changes their response
> shape, the broad harvesting heuristics in `src/harvest.js` are easy to adjust
> and are covered by the test suite.

## Development / tests

```bash
npm test        # unit tests for the usage-parsing heuristics (src/harvest.js)
npm run icons   # regenerate the PNG icons
```

The parsing logic lives in `src/harvest.js` (no DOM/chrome deps) so it can be
unit-tested directly under Node. `test/harvest.test.js` covers Anthropic-style
rate-limit headers, SSE `resets_at` payloads, and the false-positive guards
(e.g. `max_tokens` and `input_tokens` must **not** be read as session quota).

## Install (developer / unpacked)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or any Chromium browser).
3. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top-right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder.
5. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) — the meter appears in the bottom-right
   corner and populates within a few seconds.

## Privacy

Everything runs locally in your browser. No data is sent anywhere; the only
storage used is `chrome.storage.local` on your machine. The extension requests
access to `claude.ai` only.

## Regenerating icons

```bash
python3 scripts/make_icons.py
```
